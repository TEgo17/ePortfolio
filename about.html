               <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
               <p> I am an undergraduate student at the Univeristy of Toronto Mississauga. I am currently
                   in my third year of studies; I am majoring statistics while minoring in both
                   mathematics and computer science. I am particulary interested in machine learning and
                   software development. Some of my hobbies outside of school consist 
                   of playing sports, creating music and exploring new things!

               <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p> My favourite sport growing up was baseball. I have been playing organized baseball for about 
                    8 years now. The aspect I love the most about the sport of baseball is the fact that
                    it is team oritented. Everyone must play at their best for the team to succeed; from the pitcher
                    to the outfielders to the catcher. Additionally, I love playing basketball recreationally. Over the
                    last couple of years it has slowly been one of my favourite pastimes.

            <h3>Music</h3>
             <p> One of the best ways to pass time is to listen to music. There are definately many different genres
                 of music out there, but my favourite genres would have to be rap, hip-hop and occasionally classic 
                 (depending on my mood). I also like to create music in my free time. I have previosuly created beats 
                 and melodies using FLStudio. One really important takeaway I learned from creating music is having 
                 patience is key as the best things come to those who wait.

                <h3>Exploring new things</h3>
                 <p> Trying new things is always important in life in any aspect. Whether it is a new food, a new sport 
                     or doing something you would not do on a regular basis; it is vital when it comes to character 
                     development. Personally, I was a very quiet kid growing up and I despised talking and meeting new 
                     people. However, univeristy has taught me critical skills in communication and networking. It is 
                     essential to meet new people to share new experiences, new knowledge and new memories.
